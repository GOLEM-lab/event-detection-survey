When Wilson first heard the sounds of the dying wolf through the corpse of trees, he had pulled the hunting rifle off his shoulder and approached warily, expecting the scene to include fighting foxes, or a stray dog that had wandered𝑒5 into a snake nest. When he saw𝑒6 the huge shape of the wolf, he froze, unsure of what to make of the scene. The grove of trees split into a small clearing, and in the center of the circle of grass was a stone about as tall as Wilson’s waist. The wolf was stretched out over the top of the stone, head pointed one direction, feet in the other. The stone was covered in enough blood that it had dripped down the side of the stone and coated the dirt around the rock.
