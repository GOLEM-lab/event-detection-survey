Police say that on Saturday around 11:30 p.m. Kimani Gray was standing outside his home with five other young men before splitting off when he noticed two plainclothes officers in an unmarked car. After he “adjusted his waistband and continued to act in a suspicious manner,” officials say the cops got out of their car and approached Gray — who allegedly turned toward them with a loaded .38-caliber revolver in hand. The 30-year-old sergeant and 26-year-old fired shots.
